# iTutor
iOS app with beacon support for Teaching Assistant's and students. 

Through this app students can ask questions to their TA through a smartphone rather than waiting for the TA hours.
Deploying a beacon in the computer lab and with bluetooth enabled and app installed, students entering the lab will get a push notification about the current working TA in the computer lab. 

This app will allow not only help students but also TA's. Through web services, TA will get the benefit of a high quality report through which they can showcase their work.
